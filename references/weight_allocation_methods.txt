Weight Allocation Strategy 1:
- Equally weight all stocks

* the data analysis of all of the weight allocation strategies from 2 to 7 would be based on last 1 year's data from the buying date if the holding period is 1 quarter
* another alternative is to use 2 year's data

Weight Allocation Strategy 2:
- If stocks are more than 8:
    - Maximized Return Optimization (no stock more than 25% weightage and max annual standard deviation as 40%)
    - Pick the 8 with heighest weightages
    - Maximized Return Optimization (no stock more than 25% weightage and max annual standard deviation as 40%)
- Else:
    - Maximized Return Optimization (no stock more than 25% weightage and max annual standard deviation as 40%)

Weight Allocation Strategy 3:
- If stocks are more than 8:
    - Maximized Return Optimization (no stock more than 40% weightage and max annual standard deviation as 40%)
    - Pick the 8 with heighest weightages
    - Maximized Return Optimization (no stock more than 40% weightage and max annual standard deviation as 40%)
- Else:
    - Maximized Return Optimization (no stock more than 40% weightage and max annual standard deviation as 40%)

Weight Allocation Strategy 4:
- If stocks are more than 8:
    - Maximized Sharpe Ratio Optimization (no stock more than 25% weightage)
    - Pick the 8 with heighest weightages
    - Maximized Sharpe Ratio Optimization (no stock more than 25% weightage)
- Else:
    - Maximized Sharpe Ratio Optimization (no stock more than 25% weightage)

Weight Allocation Strategy 5:
- If stocks are more than 8:
    - Maximized Sharpe Ratio Optimization (no stock more than 40% weightage)
    - Pick the 8 with heighest weightages
    - Maximized Sharpe Ratio Optimization (no stock more than 40% weightage)
- Else:
    - Maximized Sharpe Ratio Optimization (no stock more than 40% weightage)

Weight Allocation Strategy 6:
- If stocks are more than 8:
    - Minimized Variance (no stock more than 25% weightage and min annual returns as 30%)
    - Pick the 8 with heighest weightages
    - Minimized Variance (no stock more than 25% weightage and min annual returns as 30%)
- Else:
    - Minimized Variance (no stock more than 25% weightage and min annual returns as 30%)

Weight Allocation Strategy 7:
- If stocks are more than 8:
    - Minimized Variance (no stock more than 40% weightage and min annual returns as 30%)
    - Pick the 8 with heighest weightages
    - Minimized Variance (no stock more than 40% weightage and min annual returns as 30%)
- Else:
    - Minimized Variance (no stock more than 40% weightage and min annual returns as 30%)

Weight Allocation Strategy 8:
- Minimized Variance (no stock more than 25% weightage and min annual returns as 20%)
- Maximized Returns (no stock more than 25% weightage and max annual standard deviation as 20%)
- Pick the top 4 from both according to weightage and if common stocks are found take more to have minimum 8
- Maximized Sharpe Ratio (no stock more than 25% weightage)

Weight Allocation Strategy 9:
- Minimized Variance (no stock more than 40% weightage and min annual returns as 20%)
- Maximized Returns (no stock more than 40% weightage and max annual standard deviation as 20%)
- Pick the top 4 from both according to weightage and if common stocks are found take more to have minimum 8
- Maximized Sharpe Ratio (no stock more than 40% weightage)

Weight Allocation Strategy 10:
- Maximized Sharpe Ratio Optimization (no stock more than 40% weightage)
- Maximized Returns Optimization (no stock more than 40% weightage, max annual standard deviation as 30%)
- Minimized Variance Optimization (no stock more than 40% weightage, min annual return as 30%)
- Pick all the stocks that have a minimum weightage of 10% in all of the above
- Maximized Returns Optimization (no stock more than 20% weightage, max annual standard deviation as 30%)

Weight Allocation Strategy 11:
- Maximized Sharpe Ratio Optimization (no stock more than 25% weightage)
- Maximized Returns Optimization (no stock more than 25% weightage, max annual standard deviation as 30%)
- Minimized Variance Optimization (no stock more than 25% weightage, min annual return as 30%)
- Pick all the stocks that have a minimum weightage of 10% in all of the above
- Maximized Returns Optimization (no stock more than 20% weightage, max annual standard deviation as 30%)
